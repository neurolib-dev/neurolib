*Easy whole-brain neural mass modeling 👩‍🔬💻🧠*

Visit the project's [github page](https://github.com/neurolib-dev/neurolib).

Neurolib allows you to easily create your own state-of-the-art whole-brain models. The main implementation is a neural mass firing rate model called `aln` which consists of two populations of excitatory and a inhibitory neurons. This `aln` model is a mean-field model of spiking adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons (AdEx).
